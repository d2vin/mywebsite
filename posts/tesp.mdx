My internship at Tribeca Early Stage Partners was an engaging and educational experience. As a VC Intern, I had the opportunity to research early-stage companies, prepare pitch deck presentations, and contribute to marketing efforts.

One of my primary accomplishments during this internship was conducting in-depth research on early-stage companies. This research was instrumental in creating pitch deck presentations for potential investors. It was fulfilling to play a role in attracting new investments to innovative startups.

Additionally, I had the chance to make a tangible impact on the firm's online presence. I took part in the redesign of the firm's website, making it more visually appealing and user-friendly. Furthermore, I contributed to social media marketing on platforms like LinkedIn, extending the reach of the firm to a wider audience.

This internship taught me the importance of thorough market research and the intricacies of venture capital. It was a journey marked by innovation, strategy, and the opportunity to contribute to the growth of early-stage companies.
