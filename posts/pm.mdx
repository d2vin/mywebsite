During my final semester at Parsons, I joined Parsons Magazine,
a student publishing organization focused on giving visibility to the work or personal projects of the community at The New School.
As the lead software developer, I was responsible the design and development of their new website.
For the design of this website, I took a minimalistic approach, inspired by the browser.
