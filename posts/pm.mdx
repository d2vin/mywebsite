During my final semester at Parsons, I had the privilege of becoming part of the dynamic team at Parsons Magazine. As a student publishing organization, our primary mission was to bring the work and personal projects of The New School community to the forefront. Given the responsibility of lead software developer, I embarked on the challenging task of designing and developing a brand-new website that would reflect our dedication to showcasing the exceptional talent within our community.

The ethos behind this project was clear: create a digital platform that would be both functional and aesthetically appealing. To accomplish this, I decided to take a minimalistic approach, drawing inspiration from the very medium through which our content would be primarily consumed - the web browser.

In line with the principles of minimalism, I designed a website that offered a clean and clutter-free user interface. The website's layout is simple to ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience. We aimed to make it effortless for visitors to navigate and discover the remarkable work of our community members.

The color palette I chose was purposefully muted, favoring subdued tones that would let the content shine. The minimalist design not only highlighted the featured content but also ensured that the website was responsive and accessible across a range of devices, catering to our diverse audience.

In addition to the aesthetics, I focused on developing a robust and efficient website. The backend architecture was designed with scalability and performance in mind. I wanted to create a platform that could grow with our organization and handle an increasing volume of content and visitors.

The final result was a website that seamlessly merged form and function. It provided a visually engaging platform that allowed Parsons Magazine to fulfill its mission of giving visibility to the incredible work and personal projects of our community members. The minimalist design emphasized our dedication to the essential aspects of web design and content presentation.

As the lead software developer for this project, I am immensely proud of what we achieved. The Parsons Magazine website stands as a testament to our commitment to quality and innovation. It continues to be a powerful tool for connecting the community at The New School and providing a space for their creative endeavors to shine.
