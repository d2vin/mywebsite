My summer internship at Lectrium was nothing short of transformative. As a Frontend Software Engineer Intern, I had the privilege of working with a dynamic team on a cutting-edge platform. This role allowed me to dive deep into the world of frontend development, design, and even marketing.

A significant part of my responsibilities revolved around developing and fine-tuning React components. It was about creating UI elements that not only looked aesthetically pleasing but also functioned seamlessly. Running unit tests ensured the reliability and high performance of these components. Implementing responsive design changes to the UI was an exciting challenge that I tackled head-on.

Beyond coding, I was involved in designing marketing materials that played a pivotal role in attracting new dealership partnerships. It was incredibly rewarding to see my designs have a real-world impact on the company's growth. My time at Lectrium was marked by hands-on learning, innovation, and a taste of the diverse skills required in today's tech industry.
