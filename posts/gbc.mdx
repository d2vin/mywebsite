In 2022, I started a remote internship at the Global Blockchain Convergence,
an organization committed to digital asset regulation.
My responsibilities included writing a weekly newsletter,
organizing meetings, and most importantly,
the design and development of their new website.
For the design of this website, I used Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.
I chose Tailwind for this project because it speeds up the development of a design system.
